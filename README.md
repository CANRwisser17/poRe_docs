# poRe_docs

Documentation for poRe, which is available from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rpore/files/)

This documentation is designed to work with version 0.17

## GUIs

The major aspect of this release is the release of two new GUIs (graphical user interfaces) - these are for testing only and should be considered a beta release.  Please use and provide feedback!

In future, these GUIs should be what you use to extract metadata and FASTQ/A.

However all of the old familiar functions are still there and are still supported if you want to use them.

The pore_rt() GUI is designed to run alongside metrichor and can extract FASTQ and metadata whilst metrichor is running

The pore_parallel() GUI is designed to run after FAST5 files have been base-called, and extracts FASTQ and metadata using a point-and-click interface.
