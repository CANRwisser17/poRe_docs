# poRe_docs

Documentation for poRe, which is available from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rpore/files/)

This documentation is designed to work with version 0.17

## GUIs

The major aspect of this release is the release of two new GUIs (graphical user interfaces).

If using poRe from within R, these GUIs should be what you use to extract metadata and FASTQ/A.

However all of the old familiar functions are still there and still supported if you want to use them.

The pore_rt() GUI is designed to run alongside metrichor and can extract FASTQ and metadata whilst metrichor is running

The pore_parallel() GUI is designed to run after FAST5 files have been base-called, and extracts FASTQ and metadata using a point-and-click interface.
